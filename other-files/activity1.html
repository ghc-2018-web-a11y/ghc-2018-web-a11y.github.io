		<h1>Activity 1</h1>
		<h2>Set up</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Download workshop materials <a href="https://github.com/ghc-2018-web-a11y/activities/archive/master.zip">here</a>, if you haven't already.</li>
			<li>Open the workshop materials folder and navigate to the <i>website/</i> directory.</li>
			<li>Open index.html in Chrome. NOTE: If you already feel comfortable using a screen reader on your machine, open index_no_screenreader.html instead.</li>
     	       </ol>
<p>
If you're using index.html (the version with the embedded screenreader) you'll notice a line of buttons on the bottom of the screen. Normal screen readers include keyboard shortcuts you can use to navigate a page. The embedded screen reader exposes these shortcuts as buttons, such as the “Next”, “Previous”, and “Heading” buttons at the bottom of the page.
Use tab and shift+tab to navigate to the next or previous interactive element. Use the left and right buttons at the bottom of the page to navigate other elements, such as text. 
</p>

		<h2>Exercises</h2>
		<p>
		   Complete the following to explore the webpage. Just explore for now instead of trying to debug; we'll do that in the next activity!
	    </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Use the "Heading" button on the screen reader to jump to all the headings in the app. Are you able to use this button to jump to the very first site title heading on the page?</li>
			<li>Use the keyboard (tab, shift+tab, and the enter key) to navigate to the "Buy" dialog for INSERT ITEM HERE item</li>
			<li>You'll notice that the tab key only goes through some elements, such as buttons. To navigate through non-interactive elements such as text nodes, you'll have to use screenreader shortcuts (simulated on our site by the headings, next, and previous buttons at the bottom of your screen). Try using these buttons to navigate to INSERT ITEM HERE.
			</li>
			<li>Try using the keyboard (tab and enter key) to buy an item.</li>
			<li>Click the first "buy" button using the mouse. You'll notice a dialog appear. Without looking at the screen, did you receive any indication from the screen reader that a dialog popped up? Do you know what the dialog is for?</li>
			<li>Using the keyboard, try to tab to the first input field in the dialog.</li>
			<li>Once you've tabbed to the input fields in the dialog, try filling out the fields. Looking at the screen, you can determine that the input fields are for quantity, name, and email. Without looking at the screen, can you figure out what each input field is for?</li>
			<li>Try navigating to the "X" button on the dialog.</li>
			<li>Try selecting the "submit" button.</li>
		</ol>
